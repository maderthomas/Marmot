Beam Element
============

Theory
------

Euler-Bernoulli beam (frame) elements, geometrically linear, in two (nodal dofs :math:`u_x, u_y, \theta_z`) or
three (:math:`u_x, u_y, u_z, \theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z`) spatial dimensions, with 2 or 3 nodes (node order
end, end, mid as for ``Bar3``; the mid node lies at the middle of the straight beam). The node fields are
``displacement`` and ``rotation`` (ordered node by node).

``BE`` = Bernoulli-Euler (the prefix leaves room for a Timoshenko family). The integration along the axis is exact
for elastic beams. In the local frame :math:`(\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3)` (:math:`\mathbf{e}_1`
from node 1 to node 2, section coordinates :math:`y, z`), the transverse displacements :math:`v, w` are Hermite
polynomials of the nodal values and rotations :math:`\theta_z = v'`, :math:`\theta_y = -w'` (no shear deformation,
no shear locking). For a linear elastic material, the 2-node element reproduces the exact nodal values of a beam
loaded at its nodes, the 3-node element also the exact deflection under a uniform line load. The generalized
strains are

.. math::

   \varepsilon_0 = u', \qquad \kappa_y = \theta_y' = -w'', \qquad \kappa_z = \theta_z' = v'', \qquad
   \chi = \varphi' \qquad \text{(2D: } \varepsilon_0, \ \kappa = \kappa_z \text{)} .

**Section** (``BeamFiberSection``). The element knows no section shapes: the section is given by its integration
points :math:`(y_f, z_f, A_f)` (2D: :math:`(y_f, A_f)`), measured from the beam axis, so any shape can be used
(the framework generates the points, e.g., EdelweissFE's beam section: rectangles, circles, tubes, I-profiles,
polygons with holes, explicit point lists, with Gauss, Lobatto or Simpson rules). Every point has its own material
instance, created by name through the hypoelastic material factory, and its own state, so any hypoelastic material
of Marmot can be used. A point has the strains

.. math::

   \varepsilon_{11} = \varepsilon_0 + z_f \kappa_y - y_f \kappa_z, \qquad
   \gamma_{12} = - s\, (z_f - z_c) \chi, \qquad \gamma_{13} = s\, (y_f - y_c) \chi ,

and is evaluated in uniaxial stress (2D, ``computeUniaxialStress``) or in the beam stress state
:math:`\sigma_{22} = \sigma_{33} = \sigma_{23} = 0` (3D, ``MarmotMaterialHypoElastic::computeBeamStress``: Newton
iteration on the free strains with state reset, condensed 3x3 tangent). The section forces :math:`(N, M_y, M_z, T)`
are the work conjugates of :math:`(\varepsilon_0, \kappa_y, \kappa_z, \chi)`. Unsymmetric sections and
non-principal axes (:math:`\int yz\,\mathrm{d}A \neq 0`) and sections off the axis couple naturally. Torsion is
Saint-Venant torsion about the centroid :math:`(y_c, z_c)` of the points without warping; the factor
:math:`s = \sqrt{J / \sum_f ((y_f-y_c)^2 + (z_f-z_c)^2) A_f}` gives the torsional stiffness :math:`GJ` for the given
torsion constant :math:`J` (:math:`s = 1` for circles and tubes); the shear center offset is neglected.

Element properties:

* 2D: :math:`[n, y_1, A_1, \dots, y_n, A_n]`;
* 3D: :math:`[v_x, v_y, v_z, J, n, y_1, z_1, A_1, \dots, y_n, z_n, A_n]` with the orientation vector
  :math:`\mathbf{v}`, whose part normal to the axis is :math:`\mathbf{e}_2` (:math:`\mathbf{e}_3 = \mathbf{e}_1
  \times \mathbf{e}_2`).

A body force (per volume) gives the consistent nodal forces and moments of the line load :math:`\mathbf{b} A`.

Quadrature point states: ``normal force``, ``bending moment`` (2D) / ``bending moments`` and ``torque`` (3D),
``axial strain``, ``curvature`` (2D) / ``curvatures`` and ``twist rate`` (3D), ``section forces`` and
``section strains`` (all components), ``elastic energy``, ``dissipation``; the state of a section point :math:`k` as
``fiber k stress`` (:math:`\sigma_{11}, \sigma_{12}, \sigma_{13}`) or ``fiber k <material state>``.

Verification (``TestBeamElement``): cantilevers (tip force, moment, axial force, line load for 3 nodes, biaxial
bending, torsion) exact; an L-profile (non-principal axes) against the analytical solution with
:math:`I_y, I_z, I_{yz}`; rigid body motions; numerical tangents in von Mises plastic states; plastic moment
:math:`f_y \sum |y_f| A_f` and axial yield force; the limit load of von Mises cantilevers converges to
:math:`f_y Z / L` (rectangle, circle, T-section with its plastic neutral axis).

Limitations: geometrically linear (small rotations; a finite rigid rotation strains the element), no shear
deformation, one material per element (a composite section = several elements on the same nodes), no distributed
surface loads, no inertia. As any displacement-based fiber beam, a plastic hinge forms at the quadrature point
nearest to the peak moment: the limit load converges linearly with the element size. A co-rotational variant can
reuse ``BeamFiberSection`` with the strains of its co-rotated frame.
